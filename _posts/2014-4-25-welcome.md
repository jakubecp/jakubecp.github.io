title: Hi I'm Jeff

I work on figuring out how to go from raw data from
next generation sequencing machines to results, 
turning public genomic data into clinically useful tools, and 
understanding how people use data analysis in real life. 

I do [statistical research](/papers), write [data analysis software](/software), [curate and create data sets](/data), write a [blog about statistics](http://simplystatistics.org), teach [people here at Hopkins](/teaching), teach [a lot of people online](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1), and work with [amazing students](/people) who go [do awesome things](/alumni). If you want to, come [do stuff with me](/jobs)

If you want to keep up with everything we are working on, follow me on Twitter [@jtleek](http://twitter.com/jtleek). The best way to contact me is my gmail account (I do not check my JHU email at all), or you can call me at my office __410-955-1166__ (fair warning I have answered that phone ~3 times total since 2009), send me a fax __410-955-0958__ (for real, fax is still a thing?!), or if you still use the pony express you could send me a letter at:

This is working version of my personal website. Informations are mainly nonsensical and they will be corrected... maybe.

I do research in [forensic entomology and ecology](/papers), write an [imaginary blog](/blog), and sometimes teach  [at CULS Prague](/teaching)

If you want to keep up with everything I am working on, follow me on  [Github](http://github.com/jakubecp). The best way to contact me is via email, or you can call me at my office __+420 22438 3630__.

This is working version of my personal website. Informations are mainly nonsensical and will be corrected... maybe.

I do [forensic entomology and ecology research](/papers), write an [imaginary blog](/blog), and sometimes I teach  [at CULS Prague](/teaching)

If you want to keep up with everything we are working on, follow me on Github [jakubecp](http://github.com/jakubecp). The best way to contact me is my mail, or you can call me at my office __+420 22438 3630__.
